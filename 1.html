but a continued rise in imported cases and infections linked to
religious facilities continued to strain the country's virus fight.<p>The country added 50 cases, including 28 local infections,
raising the total caseload to 13,293, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).<img src="ocean.jpg"width="100%"></p><p style="margin-top:15px;">
South Korea had reported more than 60 new virus cases for three consecutive days through Sunday, before falling below 50 on Monday and Tuesday.
The new daily cases rebounded to 63 a day earlier on a sharp rise in infections coming in from overseas.
